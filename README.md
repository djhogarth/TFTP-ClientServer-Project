# SYSC3303 : Real-Time Concurrent Systems

Final Project 

This is a multi-threaded TFTP Client/Server application built using Java that can send files over the internet by transforming them into UDP packets and sending them using datagram sockets. After each packet is received, an an acknowledge package is sent. Error codes are also included inside of packets if there are any errors. An error simulator is also included so that packet can be modified to test for different TFTP errors.

This project uses the following programming and networking concepts such as: synchronization of java threads, multi-threading, client-server architecture, concurrency, UDP packets, sockets, and TFTP message error/op codes .
